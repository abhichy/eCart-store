#About eCart-store

To create an eCart-store store, youâ€™ll need to create a database and have the storefront itself with middleware. The database will contain information on products. In the 
database, the data will need to be categorized. This will enable customers to easily browse data. There are many storefront plug-ins.

To accept payments, third-party payment gateways are integrated. The benefits of this are built-in security and customer trust. However, there are typically transaction fees and a
loss of the ability to tailor your payment solution to unique business needs. In order to personalize your website's eCommerce platform, creating a custom shopping cart 
is a viable option.
